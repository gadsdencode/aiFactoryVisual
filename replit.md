# LLM Training Pipeline Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application that provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and managing Large Language Model (LLM) training pipelines. The application offers real-time visualization of training metrics, model comparison capabilities, and configuration management through an intuitive web interface. It's designed to help ML engineers and researchers track training progress, compare different model configurations, and adjust hyperparameters during the training process.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit for rapid web application development
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with separate components for different dashboard sections
  - Training Dashboard: Real-time monitoring and control of training processes
  - Model Comparison: Side-by-side performance analysis of different models
  - Configuration: Parameter tuning and settings management
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs, providing real-time updates of training metrics
- **State Management**: Streamlit's session state for maintaining application state across user interactions

### Data Layer
- **Mock Data Generation**: Utility functions generate realistic training data for demonstration purposes
- **In-Memory Storage**: Training metrics, model performance data, and configuration settings stored in session state
- **Data Models**: Pandas DataFrames for structured data handling and manipulation

### UI/UX Design
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts for professional appearance
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent theming with predefined color variables for primary, secondary, success, warning, and error states
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar navigation for optimal screen real estate usage
- **Responsive Design**: Multi-column layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

### Training Pipeline Simulation
- **Control System**: Start, pause, stop, and reset functionality for training simulation
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic data generation that simulates live training metrics
- **Metric Tracking**: Loss curves, accuracy progression, learning rate schedules, and training timestamps

### Configuration Management
- **Parameter Controls**: Interactive widgets for adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, epochs
- **Model Selection**: Support for multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA, Mistral, CodeLLaMA, Vicuna)
- **Optimizer Options**: Multiple optimization algorithms with configurable parameters

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for Python-based dashboards
- **Plotly**: Interactive plotting library for real-time chart generation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library for structured data handling
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library for mathematical operations and data generation

### Visualization Components
- **Plotly Express**: High-level plotting interface for quick chart creation
- **Plotly Graph Objects**: Low-level plotting interface for custom visualizations
- **Plotly Subplots**: Multi-panel chart layouts for comprehensive metric display

### Styling and Fonts
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for UI text and JetBrains Mono for code/monospace text
- **Custom CSS**: Integrated styling system for consistent visual design

### Data Generation
- **Datetime Libraries**: Python's datetime and timedelta for timestamp management
- **Random Number Generation**: NumPy's random module for realistic training data simulation

Note: The application currently uses mock data generation for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this would likely be replaced with connections to actual training infrastructure and model registries.
